    "vector or matrix. Matrix multiplication reduces directly to standard algebraic operations. \n",
    "Solving linear systems with dense matrices will be discussed later.\n",
    "2. _Triangular_: If a matrix is upper or lower triangular, we can immediately invert using\n",
    "back-substitution. In practice we store a dense matrix and ignore the upper/lower entries.\n",
    "3. _Banded_: If a matrix is zero apart from entries a fixed distance from  the diagonal it is\n",
    "called banded and this allows for more efficient algorithms. We discuss diagonal, \n",
