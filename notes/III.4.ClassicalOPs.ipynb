    "## III.4 Classical Orthogonal Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical orthogonal polynomials are special families of orthogonal polynomials with a number\n",
    "of beautiful properties, for example\n",
    "1. Their derivatives are also OPs\n",
    "2. They are eigenfunctions of simple differential operators\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above orthogonal polynomials are uniquely defined by the weight\n",
    "$w(x)$ and the constant $k_n$. The classical orthogonal polynomials are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chebyshev polynomials (1st kind) $T_n(x)$: $w(x) = 1/\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ on $[-1,1]$.\n",
    "2.  Chebyshev polynomials (2nd kind) $U_n(x)$: $\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ on $[-1,1]$.\n",
    "2. Legendre polynomials $P_n(x)$: $w(x) = 1$ on $[-1,1]$.\n",
    "4. Ultrapsherical polynomials (my fav!): $C_n^{(λ)}(x)$: $w(x) = (1-x^2)^{λ-1/2}$ on $[-1,1]$, $λ ≠ 0$, $λ > -1/2$.\n",
    "2. Jacobi polynomials: $P_n^{(a,b)}(x)$: $w(x) = (1-x)^a (1+x)^b$ on $[-1,1]$, $a,b > -1$.\n",
    "2. Laguerre polynomials: $L_n(x)$: $w(x) = \\exp(-x)$ on $[0,∞)$.\n",
    "3. Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$: $w(x) = \\exp(-x^2)$  on $(-∞,∞)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notes we will discuss:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Chebyshev polynomials: These are closely linked to Fourier series and are one of the most powerful tools in numerics.\n",
    "2. Legendre polynomials: These have no simple closed-form expression but can be defined in terms of a Rodriguez formula, a feature that\n",
    "applies to all other classical families.\n",
