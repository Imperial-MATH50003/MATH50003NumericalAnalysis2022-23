    "# I.1 Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we discuss the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary representation: Any real number can be represented in binary, that is,\n",
    "by an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s (bits). We review  binary representation.\n",
    "2. Unsigned integers:  We discuss how computers represent non-negative integers using only\n",
    "$p$-bits, via [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic).\n",
    "3. Signed integers: we discuss how negative integers are handled using the [Two's-complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement) format.\n",
    "4. As an advanced (non-examinable) topic we discuss `BigInt`, which uses variable bit length storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin its important to have a basic model of how a computer works. Our simplified model of a computer\n",
    "will consist of a [Central Processing Unit (CPU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)—the \n",
    "brains of the computer—and [Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage#Primary_storage)—where \n",
    "data is stored. Inside the CPU there are [registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register),\n",
    "where data is temporarily stored after being loaded from memory, manipulated by the CPU, then stored back to memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is a sequence of bits: `1`s and `0`s, essentially \"on/off\" switches. These are grouped into bytes, which\n",
    "consist of 8 bits. Each byte has a memory address: a unique number specifying its location in memory. The number\n",
    "of possible addresses is limited by the processor: if a computer has a a $p$-bit CPU then each address is represented\n",
    "by $p$ bits, for a total of $2^p$ addresses (on a modern 64-bit CPU this is $2^{64} ≈ 1.8 \\times 10^{19}$ bytes).\n",
    "Further, each register consists of exactly $p$-bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CPU has the following possible operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. load data from memory addresses (up to $p$-bits) to a register\n",
    "2. store data from a register to memory addresses (up to $p$-bits)\n",
    "3. Apply some basic functions (\"+\", \"-\", etc.) to the bits in one or two registers\n",
    "and write the result to a register.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the important point is CPUs only act on $2^p$ possible sequences of bits at a time.\n",
    "That is, essentially all functions $f$ implemented on a CPU are either of the form\n",
    "$f : ℤ_{2^p} → ℤ_{2^p}$ or  $f : ℤ_{2^p} × ℤ_{2^p} → ℤ_{2^p}$,\n",
    "where we use the following notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 1 ($ℤ_m$, signed integers)** Denote the\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ℤ_m := \\{0 , 1 , …, m-1 \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitations this imposes on representing integers is substantial. \n",
    "If we have an implementation of $+$, which we shall denote $⊕ₘ$, how can we possibly represent\n",
    "$m + 1$ in this implementation when the result is above the largest possible integer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution that is used is straightforward: the CPU uses modular arithmetic. E.g., we have\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(m-1) ⊕ₘ 1 = m\\ ({\\rm mod}\\ m) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In this chapter we discuss the implications of this approach and how it works with negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Julia in these notes to explore what is happening as a computer does integer arithmetic.\n",
    "We load an external package\n",
    "which implements functions `printbits` (and `printlnbits`)\n",
    "to print the bits (and with a newline) of numbers in colour:"
