    "\n",
    "A very important class of matrices are _orthogonal_ and _unitary_ matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 1 (orthogonal/unitary matrix)** A square real matrix is _orthogonal_ if its inverse is its transpose:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "O(n) = \\{Q ∈ ℝ^{n × n} : Q^⊤Q = I \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A square complex matrix is _unitary_ if its inverse is its adjoint:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(n) = \\{Q ∈ ℂ^{n × n} : Q^⋆Q = I \\}.\n",

    "Here the adjoint is the same as the conjugate-transpose: $Q^⋆ := Q̄^⊤$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Note that $O(n) ⊂ U(n)$ as for real matrices $Q^⋆ = Q^⊤$. Because in either case $Q^{-1} = Q^⋆$ we also have\n",
    "$Q Q^⋆ = I$ (which for real matrices is $Q Q^⊤ = I$). These matrices are particularly important for\n",
    "numerical linear algebra for a number of reasons (we'll explore these properties in the problem sheets):\n",

    "1. They are norm-preserving: for any vector $𝐱 ∈ ℂ^n$ we have\n",

    "3. For $Q ∈ O(n)$,  $\\det Q = ±1$.\n",
    "2. They are trivially invertible (just take the transpose).\n",

    "1. _Permutation_: A permutation matrix permutes the rows of a vector and is a representation of the symmetric group.\n",
    "2. _Rotations_: The simple rotations are also known as $2 × 2$ special orthogonal matrices ($SO(2)$)  and correspond to rotations in 2D.\n",
    "3. _Reflections_:  Reflections are $n × n$ orthogonal matrices that have simple definitions in terms of a single vector.\n",
