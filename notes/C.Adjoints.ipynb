    "1. Complex inner-products\n",
    "2. Adjoints\n",
    "3. Normal Matrices and the spectral theorem\n",

    "## 1. Complex-inner products\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use bars to denote the complex-conjugate: if $z = x + {\\rm i}y$ then $z̄ = x - {\\rm i}y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 1 (inner-product)** \n",
    "An _inner product_ $⟨⋅,⋅⟩$ over $ℂ$ satisfies, for $𝐱, 𝐲, 𝐳 ∈ ℂ^n$ and $a,b ∈ ℂ$,\n",
    "1. Conjugate symmetry: $⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩ = \\overline{⟨𝐲, 𝐱⟩}$\n",
    "2. Linearity: $⟨𝐱, a 𝐲+b 𝐳⟩ = a⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩ + b⟨𝐱, 𝐳⟩$. (Some authors use linearity in the first argument.)\n",
    "3. Positive-definiteness: for $𝐱 ≠ 0$ we have $⟨𝐱,𝐱⟩ > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will usually use the standard inner product defined on $ℂ^n$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩ := 𝐱̄^⊤𝐲 = ∑_{k=1}^n x̄_k y_k\n",

    "**Definition 2 (adjoint)** Given an inner product, an adjoint of a matrix $A ∈ ℂ^{m × n}$ is the unique matrix\n",
    "$A^⋆$ satisfying\n",

    "⟨𝐱, A𝐲⟩ = ⟨Ā 𝐱, 𝐲⟩\n",

    "\n",
    "**Proposition 1 (adjoints are conjugate-transposes)**\n",
    "For the standard inner product, $A^⋆ = Ā^⊤$. If $A ∈ ℝ^{m × n}$ then it reduces to the transpose $A^⋆ = A^⊤$.\n",

    "\n",
    "An important property of normal matrices is that they are diagonalisable using unitary\n",
    "eigenvectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 1 (spectral theorem for normal matrices)** \n",
    "If $A ∈ ℂ^{n × n}$ is normal then it is diagonalisable with\n",
