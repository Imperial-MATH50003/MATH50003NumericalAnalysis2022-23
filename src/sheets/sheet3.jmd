# Problem Sheet 3

This problem sheet explores the error in using divided differences. 

Please complete the problems using pen-and-paper, though some can be verified using Julia.

**Problem 1.1** Use Taylor's theorem to derive an error bound for central differences
$$
f'(x) ≈ {f(x + h) - f(x - h) \over 2h}.
$$
in terms of 
$$
M = \max_{y ∈ [x-h,x+h]}\left| f'''(y)\right|.
$$



**Problem 1.2**
Find an error bound when implemented in floating point arithmetic, assuming that
$$f^{\rm FP}(x) = f(x) + \delta_x$$
where $|\delta_x| \leq c ϵ_{\rm m}$. You may assume all operations result in numbers
in the normalised range.




**Problem 1.3**
Derive the error for central differences exactly for the different cases to explain the observed behaviour.

**Problem 2.1** Use Taylor's theorem to derive an error bound on the second-order derivative approximation
$$
f''(x) ≈ {f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h) \over h^2}
$$
in terms of 
$$
M = \max_{y∈[x-h,x+h]}\left|f'''(y)\right|.
$$



**Problem 2.2** Find an error bound when implemented in floating point arithmetic, assuming that
$$
f^{\rm FP}(x) = f(x) + δ_x
$$
where $|δ_x| \leq c ϵ_{\rm m}$.

**Problem 3.1** 
Show that dual numbers $𝔻$ are a _commutative ring_, that is, for all $a,b,c ∈ 𝔻$ the following are satisfied:
1. _additive associativity_: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
2. _additive commutativity_: $a + b = b + a$
3. _additive identity_: There exists $0 ∈ 𝔻$ such that $a + 0 = a$.
4. _additive inverse_: There exists $-a$ such that $(-a) + a = 0$.
5. _multiplicative associativity_: $(ab)c = a(bc)$
6. _multiplictive commutativity_: $ab = ba$
7. _multiplictive identity_: There exists $1 ∈ 𝔻$ such that $1a= a$.
8. _distributive_: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$



**Problem 3.2 (C)** A _field_ is a commutative ring such that $0 ≠ 1$ and all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse, i.e.,
there exists $a^{-1}$ such that $a a^{-1} = 1$. Why isn't $𝔻$ a field?

**Problem 4** A _matrix representation_ of a ring are maps from a group/ring to matrices such that matrix addition and multiplication
behave exactly like addition and multiplication of the ring. 
That is, if $A$ and $B$ are elements of the ring and $ρ$ is a representation, then
$$
ρ(A + B) = ρ(A) + ρ(B) \hbox{ and } ρ(AB) = ρ(A)ρ(B).
$$
Show that the following are matrix representations of complex numbers and dual numbers (respectively):
$$
\begin{align*}
ρ_{\rm c}(a + b {\rm i}) &= \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -b & a \end{pmatrix}, \\
ρ_ϵ(a + b {\rm ϵ}) &= \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
$$

**Problem 5 (C)** What is the correct definition of division on dual numbers, i.e.,
$$
(a + b ϵ )/(c + d ϵ ) = s + t ϵ
$$
for what choice of $s$ and $t$? Use dual numbers to compute the derivative of the following functions at $x = 0.1$:
$$
\exp(\exp x \cos x + \sin x), \prod_{k=1}^3 \left({x \over k}-1\right),\hbox{ and } f^{\rm s}_2(x) = {1 + {x - 1 \over 2 + {x-1 \over 2}}}
$$
