# III.3 Orthogonal Polynomials

Fourier series proved very powerful for approximating periodic functions.
If periodicity is lost, however, uniform convergence is lost. In this chapter
we introduce alternative bases, _Orthogonal Polynomials (OPs)_ built on polynomials that are applicable in
the non-periodic setting. That is we consider expansions of the form
$$
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^∞ c_k p_k(x)
$$
where $p_k(x)$ are special families of polynomials, $c_k$ are expansion coefficients. 
The computation of the coefficients $c_k ≈ c_k^n$ will wait until the next section.

Why not use monomials as in Taylor series? Hidden in the previous lecture was that we could effectively
compute Taylor coefficients by evaluating on the unit circle in the complex plane, _only_ if the radius of convergence
was 1. Many functions are smooth on say $[-1,1]$ but have non-convergent Taylor series, e.g.:
$$
{1 \over 25x^2 + 1}
$$
While orthogonal polynomials span the same space as monomials, and therefore we can in theory write an
approximation in monomials, orthogonal polynomials are _much_ more stable.



In addition to numerics, OPs play a very important role in many mathematical areas
including functional analysis, integrable systems, singular integral equations,
complex analysis, and random matrix theory.

1. General properties: we define orthogonal polynomials
2. Three-term recurrences
3. Jacobi matrices


**Remark (advanced)** Going beyond what we discuss here are many other beautiful properties of orthogonal 
polynomials that are useful in computation, analysis, representation theory,
quantum mechanics, etc. These include sparse recurrence relationships for derivatives,
that they are eigenfunctions of differential equations, their asymptotics, 
generating functions, etc. 


## 1. General properties

**Definition 1 (graded polynomial basis)**
A set of polynomials $\{p_0(x), p_1(x), … \}$ is _graded_ if $p_n$ is
precisely degree $n$: i.e.,
$$
p_n(x) = k_n x^n + k_n^{(1)} x^{n-1} + ⋯ + k_n^{(n-1)} x + k_n^{(n)}
$$
for $k_n ≠ 0$.

Note that if $p_n$ are graded then $\{p_0(x), …, p_n(x) \}$
are a basis of all polynomials of degree $n$.


**Definition 2 (orthogonal polynomials)**
Given an (integrable) _weight_ $w(x) > 0$ for $x ∈ (a,b)$,
which defines a continuous inner product
$$
⟨f,g⟩ = ∫_a^b  f(x) g(x) w(x) {\rm d} x
$$
a graded polynomial basis $\{p_0(x), p_1(x), … \}$
are _orthogonal polynomials (OPs)_ if
$$
⟨p_n,p_m⟩ = 0
$$
whenever $n ≠ m$. We assume through that integrals of polynomials are finite:
$$
∫_a^b  x^k w(x) {\rm d} x < ∞.
$$


Note in the above
$$
h_n := ⟨p_n,p_n⟩ = \|p_n\|^2 = ∫_a^b  p_n(x)^2 w(x) {\rm d} x > 0.
$$

Multiplying any orthogonal polynomial by a nonzero constant necessarily is also an orthogonal
polynomial. We have two standard normalisations:


**Definition 3 (orthonormal polynomials)**
A set of orthogonal polynomials $\{q_0(x), q_1(x), … \}$
are _orthonormal_ if $\|q_n\| = 1$.

**Definition 4 (monic orthogonal polynomials)**
A set of orthogonal polynomials $\{π_0(x), π_1(x), … \}$
are _monic_ if $k_n = 1$.


**Proposition 1 (existence)** Given a weight $w(x)$, monic orthogonal polynomials
exist.

**Proof**

Existence follows immediately from the Gram–Schmidt procedure. That is,
define $π_0(x) := 1$ and
$$
π_n(x) := x^n - ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} {⟨x^n,π_k⟩ \over \|π_k\|^2} π_k(x)
$$

∎


We are primarly concerned with the usage of orthogonal polynomials in
approximating functions. First we observe the following:

**Proposition 2 (expansion)**
If $r(x)$ is a degree $n$ polynomial and $\{p_n\}$ are orthogonal then
$$
r(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n {⟨p_k,r⟩ \over \|p_k\|^2} p_k(x)
$$
Note for $\{q_n\}$ orthonormal we have
$$
r(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n ⟨q_k,r⟩ q_k(x).
$$

**Proof**
Because $\{p_0,…,p_n \}$ are a basis of polynomials we can
write
$$
r(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n r_k p_k(x)
$$
for constants $r_k ∈ ℝ$.
By linearity we have
$$
⟨p_m,r⟩ = ∑_{k=0}^n r_k ⟨p_m,p_k⟩= r_m ⟨p_m,p_m⟩
$$
∎

**Corollary 1 (zero inner product)**
If a degree $n$ polynomial $r$ satisfies
$$
0 = ⟨p_0,r⟩ = … = ⟨p_n,r⟩
$$
then $r = 0$.

**Corollary 2 (uniqueness)**
Monic orthogonal polynomials are unique.

**Proof**
If $p_n(x)$ and $π_n(x)$ are both monic orthogonal polynomials
then $r(x) = p_n(x) - π_n(x)$ is degree $n-1$ but satisfies
$$
⟨r, π_k⟩ = ⟨p_n, π_k⟩ - ⟨π_n, π_k⟩ = 0
$$
for $k = 0,…,{n-1}$. Note $⟨p_n, π_k⟩ = 0$ can be seen by
expanding
$$
π_k(x) = ∑_{j=0}^k c_j p_j(x).
$$
∎


OPs are uniquely defined (up to a constant) by the
property that they are orthogonal to all lower degree polynomials.

**Theorem 1 (orthogonal to lower degree)**
Given a weight $w(x)$, 
a polynomial
$$
p(x) = k_n x^n + O(x^{n-1})
$$ 
with $k_n ≠ 0$ satisfies
$$
⟨p,f_m⟩ = 0
$$
for all  polynomials $f_m$ of degree $m < n$ if and only if
$p(x) = k_n π_n(x)$ where $π_n(x)$ are the monic orthogonal polynomials.
Therefore an orthogonal polynomial is uniquely
defined by the weight and leading order coefficient $k_n$.


We leave this proof to the problem sheets.
A consequence of this is that orthonormal polynomials are always a
constant multiple of orthogonal polynomials.



## 2. 3-term recurrence

The most _fundamental_ property of orthogonal polynomials is their three-term
recurrence.

**Theorem 2 (3-term recurrence, 2nd form)**
If $\{p_n\}$ are OPs then there exist real constants
$a_n, b_n ≠0,c_{n-1} ≠0$
such that
$$
\begin{align*}
x p_0(x) &= a_0 p_0(x) + b_0 p_1(x)  \\
x p_n(x) &= c_{n-1} p_{n-1}(x) + a_n p_n(x) + b_n p_{n+1}(x)
\end{align*}
$$
**Proof**
The $n=0$ case is immediate since $\{p_0,p_1\}$ are a basis of degree 1 polynomials.
The $n >0$ case follows from
$$
⟨x p_n, p_k⟩ = ⟨ p_n, xp_k⟩ = 0
$$
for $k < n-1$ as $x p_k$ is of degree $k+1 < n$.

Note that
$$
b_n = {⟨p_{n+1}, x p_n⟩ \over \|p_{n+1} \|^2} ≠ 0
$$
since $x p_n = k_n x^{n+1} + O(x^n)$ is precisely degree
$n$. Further,
$$
c_{n-1} = {⟨p_{n-1}, x p_n⟩ \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } =
{⟨p_n, x p_{n-1}⟩  \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } =  b_{n-1}{\|p_n\|^2  \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } ≠ 0.
$$



∎




Clearly if $π_n$ is monic then so is $x π_n$ which leads to the following:

**Corollary 3 (monic 3-term recurrence)** If $\{π_n\}$ are monic then $b_n =  1$.

**Corollary 4 (Gram–Schmidt revisited)**
We can define $π_{n+1}(x)$ in terms of $π_{n-1}$ and $π_n$:
$$
π_{n+1}(x) = x π_n(x) - a_n π_n(x) - c_{n-1} π_{n-1}(x)
$$
where
$$
a_n = {⟨x π_n, π_n⟩ \over \| π_n\|^2} \qquad \hbox{and} \qquad c_{n-1} = {⟨x π_n, π_{n-1}⟩ \over \| π_{n-1}\|^2}
$$

**Example 1** What are the  monic OPs $π_0(x),…,π_3(x)$ with respect to $w(x) = 1$ on $[0,1]$?
We can construct these using Gram–Schmidt, but exploiting the 3-term recurrence to reduce the computational cost.
We have $π_0(x) = 1$, which we see is orthogonal:
$$
\|π_0\|^2 = ⟨π_0,π_0⟩ = ∫_0^1 {\rm d} x = 1.
$$
We know from the 3-term recurrence that
$$
x π_0(x) = a_0 π_0(x) +  π_1(x)
$$
where
$$
a_0 = {⟨π_0,x π_0⟩  \over \|π_0\|^2} = ∫_0^1 x {\rm d} x = 1/2.
$$
Thus
$$
\begin{align*}
π_1(x) = x π_0(x) - a_0 π_0(x) = x-1/2 \\
\|π_1\|^2 = ∫_0^1 (x^2 - x + 1/4) {\rm d} x = 1/12
\end{align*}
$$
From
$$
x π_1(x) = c_0 π_0(x) + a_1 π_1(x) +  π_2(x)
$$
we have
$$
\begin{align*}
c_0 &= {⟨π_0,x π_1⟩  \over \|π_0\|^2} = ∫_0^1 (x^2 - x/2) {\rm d} x = 1/12 \\
a_1 &= {⟨π_1,x π_1⟩  \over \|π_1\|^2} = 12 ∫_0^1 (x^3 - x^2 + x/4) {\rm d} x = 1/2 \\
π_2(x) &= x π_1(x) - c_0 - a_1 π_1(x) = x^2 - x + 1/6 \\
\|π_2\|^2 &= \int_0^1 (x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2/3 - x/3 + 1/36) {\rm d} x = {1 \over 180}
\end{align*}
$$
Finally, from
$$
x π_2(x) = c_1 π_1(x) + a_2 π_2(x) +  π_3(x)
$$
we have
$$
\begin{align*}
c_1 &= {⟨π_1,x π_2⟩  \over \|π_1\|^2} = 12 ∫_0^1 (x^4 - 3x^3/2 +2x^2/3 -x/12)  {\rm d} x = 1/15 \\
a_2 &= {⟨π_2,x π_2⟩  \over \|π_2\|^2} = 180 ∫_0^1 (x^5 - 2x^4 +4x^3/3 - x^2/3 + x/36) {\rm d} x = 1/2 \\
π_3(x) &= x π_2(x) - c_1 π_1(x)- a_2 π_2(x) = x^3 - x^2 + x/6 - x/15 + 1/30 -x^2/2 + x/2 - 1/12 \\
&= x^3 - 3x^2/2 + 3x/5 -1/20
\end{align*}
$$


## 3. Jacobi matrices


The three-term recurrence can also be interpreted as a matrix known
as the Jacobi matrix:

**Corollary 5 (Jacobi matrix)**
For
$$
P(x) := [p_0(x) | p_1(x) | ⋯]
$$
then we have
$$
x P(x) = P(x) \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} a_0 & c_0 \\
                                                        b_0 & a_1 & c_1\\
                                                        & b_1 & a_2 & ⋱ \\
                                                        && ⋱ & ⋱
                                                        \end{bmatrix}}_X
$$
More generally, for any polynomial $a(x)$ we have
$$
a(x) P(x) = P(x) a(X).
$$
The Jacobi matrix is $J := X^⊤$.

For the special cases of orthonormal and monic polynomials we have extra structure:

**Corollary 6 (orthonormal 3-term recurrence)** 
The Jacobi matrix of a family of orthogonal polynomials $p_n(x)$ is symmetric:
$$
J = X = \begin{bmatrix} a_0 & b_0 \\
                                                        b_0 & a_1 & b_1\\
                                                        & b_1 & a_2 & ⋱ \\
                                                        && ⋱ & ⋱
                                                        \end{bmatrix}
$$
if and only if $p_n(x)$ is up-to-sign a fixed constant scaling of orthonormal:
for $q_n(x) := π_n(x)/\|π_n\|^2$ we have for a fixed $α ∈ ℝ$ and $s_n ∈ \{-1,1\}$
$$
p_n(x) = α s_n q_n(x).
$$

**Proof**
Noting that $\|q_n\|^2 = 1$ and thence $\|p_n\|^2 = α^2$,
if $p_n(x) = α s_n q_n(x)$ we have
$$
b_n = {⟨xp_n, p_{n+1}⟩ \over \|p_{n+1}\|^2} = s_n s_{n+1} ⟨x q_n, q_{n+1}⟩ =
s_n s_{n+1} ⟨q_n, x q_{n+1}⟩ = {⟨p_n, xp_{n+1}⟩ \over \|p_n\|^2} = c_{n-1}.
$$

Conversely, suppose $X = X^⊤$, i.e., $b_n = c_{n-1}$ and write the corresponding
orthogonal polynomials as $p_n(x) = α_n q_n(x)$. We have
$$
b_n = {⟨xp_n, p_{n+1}⟩ \over \|p_{n+1}\|^2} = 
{α_n \over α_{n+1}} ⟨xq_n, q_{n+1}⟩ = 
{α_n \over α_{n+1}} ⟨q_n, x q_{n+1}⟩ = {α_n^2 \over α_{n+1}^2} {⟨p_n, xp_{n+1}⟩ \over \|p_n\|^2}
= {α_n^2 \over α_{n+1}^2} c_{n-1} = {α_n^2 \over α_{n+1}^2} b_n.
$$
Hence $α_n^2 = α_{n+1}^2$ which implies that $α_{n+1} = ± α_n$. By induction the result follows,
where $α := α_0$.
∎

**Remark (advanced)** If you are worried about multiplication of infinite matrices/vectors
note it is well-defined by the standard definition because it is banded.
It can also be defined in terms of functional analysis where one considers these
as linear operators (functions of functions) between vector spaces.

**Remark (advanced)** Every integrable weight generates a family of
orthonormal polynomials, which in turn generates a symmetric Jacobi matrix.
There is a "Spectral Theorem for Jacobi matrices" that says one can go the
other way: every tridiagonal symmetric matrix with bounded entries is a Jacobi
matrix for some integrable weight with compact support. This is an example of what
[Barry Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Simon) calls a "Gem of spectral theory",
that is.


**Example 2 (uniform weight Jacobi matrix)** Consider the
monic orthogonal polynomials $π_0(x),π_1(x),…,π_3(x)$ for $w(x) = 1$ on $[0,1]$ constructed above.
We can write the 3-term recurrence coefficients we have computed above as the Jacobi matrix:
$$
x [π_0(x)| π_1(x)| ⋯] = [π_0(x)| π_1(x)| ⋯] \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/12 \\
                                                            1 & 1/2 & 1/15 \\
                                                            & 1 & 1/2 & ⋱ \\
                                                            & & ⋱ & ⋱ \end{bmatrix}}_X
$$
We can compute the orthonormal polynomials, using
$$
\|π_3\|^2 = \int_0^1 (x^6 - 3x^5 + 69x^4/20 -19x^3/10 + 51x^2/100 - 3x/50 + 1/400) {\rm d}x = {1 \over 2800}
$$
as:
$$
\begin{align*}
q_0(x) &= π_0(x) \\
q_1(x) &= \sqrt{12} π_1(x)= \sqrt{3} (2  x - 1) \\
q_2(x) &= \sqrt{180} π_2(x) = \sqrt{5} (6x^2 - 6x + 1) \\
q_3(x) &= \sqrt{2800} π_3(x) = \sqrt{7} (20x^3-30x^2 + 12x - 1)
\end{align*}
$$
which have the Jacobi matrix
$$
\begin{align*}
x [q_0(x)| q_1(x)| ⋯] &= x [π_0(x)| π_1(x)| ⋯] \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ & 2\sqrt{3} \\ && 6 \sqrt{5} \\ &&& 20 \sqrt{7} \\
&&&& ⋱
\end{bmatrix}}_D \\
&= [q_0(x)| q_1(x)| ⋯] D^{-1} X D = 
     \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/\sqrt{12} \\
                    1/\sqrt{12} & 1/2 &  1/\sqrt{15} \\
                    & 1/\sqrt{15} & 1/2 & ⋱ \\
                    & ⋱ & ⋱ \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
which is indeed symmetric. The problem sheet explores a more elegant way of doing this.


**Example 3 (expansion)** Consider expanding a low degree polynomial like $f(x) = x^2$ in $π_n(x)$. We have
$$
⟨π_0, f⟩ = ∫_0^1 x^2 {\rm d} x = 1/3
⟨π_1, f⟩ = ∫_0^1 x^2 (x - 1/2) {\rm d} x = 1/12
⟨π_2, f⟩ = ∫_0^1 x^2 (x^2 - x + 1/6) {\rm d} x = 1/180
$$
Thus we have:
$$
f(x) = {π_0(x) \over 3} + π_1(x) + π_2(x) = [π_0(x) | π_1(x) | π_2(x) | ⋯] \begin{bmatrix} 1/3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ ⋮ \end{bmatrix}
$$
We multiply (using that $b_2 = 1$ for monic OPs) to deduce:
$$
\begin{align*}
x f(x) &= x[π_0(x) | π_1(x) | π_2(x) | ⋯] \begin{bmatrix} 1/3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ ⋮ \end{bmatrix} \\
&= [π_0(x) | π_1(x) | π_2(x) | ⋯] X \begin{bmatrix} 1/3 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ ⋮ \end{bmatrix}
= [π_0(x) | π_1(x) | π_2(x) | ⋯]  \begin{bmatrix} 1/4 \\ 9/10 \\ 3/2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ ⋮ \end{bmatrix} \\
&= {π_0(x) \over 4} + {9 π_1(x) \over 10} + {3 π_2(x) \over 2} + π_3(x)
\end{align*}
$$
