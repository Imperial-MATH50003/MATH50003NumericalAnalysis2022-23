# C. Adjoints and Normal Matrices

Here we review 

1. Complex inner-products
2. Adjoints
3. Normal Matrices and the spectral theorem


## 1. Complex-inner products

We will use bars to denote the complex-conjugate: if $z = x + {\rm i}y$ then $z̄ = x - {\rm i}y$.


**Definition 1 (inner-product)** 
An _inner product_ $⟨⋅,⋅⟩$ over $ℂ$ satisfies, for $𝐱, 𝐲, 𝐳 ∈ ℂ^n$ and $a,b ∈ ℂ$,
1. Conjugate symmetry: $⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩ = \overline{⟨𝐲, 𝐱⟩}$
2. Linearity: $⟨𝐱, a 𝐲+b 𝐳⟩ = a⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩ + b⟨𝐱, 𝐳⟩$. (Some authors use linearity in the first argument.)
3. Positive-definiteness: for $𝐱 ≠ 0$ we have $⟨𝐱,𝐱⟩ > 0$.


We will usually use the standard inner product defined on $ℂ^n$:
$$
⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩ := 𝐱̄^⊤𝐲 = ∑_{k=1}^n x̄_k y_k
$$
Note that $\overline{zw} = z̄w̄$ and $\overline{z+w} = z̄+w̄$ together imply that:
$$
\overline{A 𝐱} = Ā 𝐱̄.
$$



## 2. Adjoints

**Definition 2 (adjoint)** Given an inner product, an adjoint of a matrix $A ∈ ℂ^{m × n}$ is the unique matrix
$A^⋆$ satisfying
$$
⟨𝐱, A𝐲⟩ = ⟨Ā 𝐱, 𝐲⟩
$$
for all $𝐱 ∈ ℂ^m$, $𝐲 ∈ ℂ^n$. (Note this definition can be extended to other inner products.)

**Proposition 1 (adjoints are conjugate-transposes)**
For the standard inner product, $A^⋆ = Ā^⊤$. If $A ∈ ℝ^{m × n}$ then it reduces to the transpose $A^⋆ = A^⊤$.

**Proof**

$$
A_{k,j} = ⟨𝐞_k, A 𝐞_j⟩ = ⟨A^⋆ 𝐞_k, 𝐞_j⟩ = 𝐞_k^⊤ \overline{(A^⋆)}^⊤ 𝐞_j = \overline{A_{j,k}^⋆}
$$
∎


In this module we will assume the standard inner product (unless otherwise stated), that is,
we will only use the standard adjoint $A^⋆ = Ā^⊤$.
Note if $A = A^⋆$ a matrix is called _Hermitian_. If it is real it is also called _Symmetric_.


## 3. Normal matrices

**Definition 3 (normal)** A (square) _normal matrix_ commutes with its adjoint:
$$
A A^⋆ = A^⋆ A
$$


Examples of normal matrices include:
2. Symmetric and Hermitian: ($A^⋆ A = A^2 = AA^⋆$)
3. Orthogonal and Unitary: ($Q^⋆ Q = I = Q Q^⋆$)

An important property of normal matrices is that they are diagonalisable using unitary
eigenvectors:


**Theorem 1 (spectral theorem for normal matrices)** 
If $A ∈ ℂ^{n × n}$ is normal then it is diagonalisable with
unitary eigenvectors:
$$
A = Q Λ Q^⋆
$$
where $Q ∈ U(n)$ and $Λ$ is diagonal.

We will prove this later in the module. There is an important corollary for symmetric
matrices that you may have seen before:

**Corollary 1 (spectral theorem for symmetric matrices)** 
If $A ∈ ℝ^{n × n}$ is symmetric then it is diagonalisable with
orthogonal eigenvectors:
$$
A = Q Λ Q^⊤
$$
where $Q ∈ O(n)$ and $Λ$ is real and diagonal.

**Proof**

$A = Q Λ Q^⋆$ since its normal hence we find that:
$$
Λ̄ = Λ^⋆ = (Q^⋆ A Q)^⋆ =  Q^⋆ A^⊤ Q = Q^⋆ A Q = Λ
$$
which shows that $Λ$ is real. The fact that $Q$ is  real  follows since the
column $𝐪_k = Q 𝐞_k$ is in the null space of the real matrix $A - λₖ I$.
