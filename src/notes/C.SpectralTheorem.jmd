# C. Spectral theorem for symmetric and normal matrices

Here we review the proof of the spectral theorem for symmetric and normal
matrices, as well as adjoints (complex-conjugation). Here we use the standard inner product
defined on $ℂ^n$:
$$
⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩ := 𝐱̄^⊤𝐲 = ∑_{k=1}^n x̄_k y_k
$$
The bars indicate complex conjugate: if $z = x + {\rm i}y$ then $z̄ = x - {\rm i}y$.
Note that for constants $c ∈ ℂ$ this convention satisfies
$$
⟨c 𝐱, 𝐲⟩ = c̄ ⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩, ⟨𝐱, c 𝐲⟩ = c ⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩
$$
which may differ from the convention you've seen before.
Note that $\overline{zw} = z̄w̄$ and $\overline{z+w} = z̄+w̄$ together imply that:
$$
\overline{A 𝐱} = Ā 𝐱̄.
$$



## 1. Adjoints

**Definition 1 (adjoint)** An adjoint of a matrix $A ∈ ℂ^{m × n}$ is the unique matrix
$A^⋆$ satisfying
$$
⟨𝐱, A𝐲⟩ = ⟨Ā 𝐱, 𝐲⟩
$$
for all $𝐱 ∈ ℂ^m$, $𝐲 ∈ ℂ^n$. (Note this definition can be extended to other inner products.)

**Proposition 1 (adjoints are conjugate-transposes)**
For the standard inner product, $A^⋆ = Ā^⊤$. If $A ∈ ℝ^{m × n}$ then it reduces to the transpose $A^⋆ = A^⊤$.

**Proof**

$$
A_{k,j} = ⟨𝐞_k, A 𝐞_j⟩ = ⟨A^⋆ 𝐞_k, 𝐞_j⟩ = 𝐞_k^⊤ \overline{(A^⋆)}^⊤ 𝐞_j = \overline{A_{j,k}^⋆}
$$
∎


Note if $A = A^⋆$ a matrix is called _Hermitian_. If it is real it is also called _Symmetric_.

## 2. Normal matrices

**Definition 2 (normal)** A (square) _normal matrix_ commutes with its adjoint:
$$
A A^⋆ = A^⋆ A
$$


Examples of normal matrices include:
2. Symmetric and Hermitian: ($A^⋆ A = A^2 = AA^⋆$)
3. Orthogonal and Unitary: ($Q^⋆ Q = I = Q Q^⋆$)


## 2. Spectral theorem for symmetric matrices


**Theorem (spectral theorem for normal matrices)** 

If $A ∈ ℂ^{n × n}$ is normal then it is diagonalisable with
unitary eigenvectors:
$$
A = Q Λ Q^⋆
$$
where $Q ∈ U(n)$ and $Λ$ is diagonal.

**Proof**

Recall every eigenvalue $λ$ has at least one eigenvector $𝐪$ which we can
normalize, but this can be
complex. Thus we have
$$
λ = λ 𝐪^⋆𝐪  = 𝐪^⋆ A 𝐪 = (A𝐪)^⋆ 𝐪 
$$
