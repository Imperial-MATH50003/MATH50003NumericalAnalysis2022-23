# II.5 Norms

In this lecture we discuss matrix and vector norms.

1. Vector norms: we discuss the standard $p$-norm for vectors in $ℝ^n$.
2. Matrix norms: we discuss how two vector norms can be used to induce a norm on matrices. These
satisfy an additional multiplicative inequality.


## 1. Vector norms

Recall the definition of a (vector-)norm:

**Definition (vector-norm)** A norm $\|\cdot\|$ on $ℝ^n$ is a function that satisfies the following, for $𝐱,𝐲 ∈ ℝ^n$ and
$c ∈ ℝ$:x
1. Triangle inequality: $\|𝐱 + 𝐲 \| ≤ \|𝐱\| + \|𝐲\|$
2. Homogeneity: $\| c 𝐱 \| = |c| \| 𝐱 \|$
3. Positive-definiteness: $\|𝐱\| = 0$ implies that $𝐱 = 0$.


Consider the following example:

**Definition (p-norm)**
For $1 ≤ p < ∞$ and $𝐱 \in ℝ^n$, define the $p$-norm:
$$
\|𝐱\|_p := \left(\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k|^p\right)^{1/p}
$$
where $x_k$ is the $k$-th entry of $𝐱$. 
For $p = ∞$ we define
$$
\|𝐱\|_∞ := \max_k |x_k|
$$

**Theorem (p-norm)** $\| ⋅ \|_p$ is a norm for $1 ≤ p ≤ ∞$.

**Proof**

We will only prove the case $p = 1, 2, ∞$ as general $p$ is more involved.

Homogeneity and positive-definiteness are straightforward: e.g.,
$$
\|c 𝐱\|_p = (\sum_{k=1}^n |cx_k|^p)^{1/p} = (|c|^p \sum_{k=1}^n |x_k|^p)^{1/p} = |c| \| 𝐱 \|
$$
and if $\| 𝐱 \|_p = 0$ then all $|x_k|^p$ are have to be zero.

For $p = 1,∞$ the triangle inequality is also straightforward:
$$
\| 𝐱 + 𝐲 \|_∞ = \max_k (|x_k + y_k|) ≤ \max_k (|x_k| + |y_k|) ≤ \|𝐱\|_∞ + \|𝐲\|_∞
$$
and
$$
\| 𝐱 + 𝐲 \|_1 = \sum_{k=1}^n |x_k + y_k| ≤  \sum_{k=1}^n (|x_k| + |y_k|) = \| 𝐱 \|_1 + \| 𝐲\|_1
$$

For $p = 2$ it can be proved using the Cauchy–Schwartz inequality:
$$
|𝐱^⊤ 𝐲| ≤ \| 𝐱 \|_2 \| 𝐲 \|_2
$$
That is, we have
$$
\| 𝐱 + 𝐲 \|^2 = \|𝐱\|^2 + 2 𝐱^⊤ 𝐲 + \|𝐲\|^2 ≤ \|𝐱\|^2 + 2\| 𝐱 \| \| 𝐲 \| + \|𝐲\|^2 = (\| 𝐱 \| +  \| 𝐲 \|)
$$


∎


 In Julia, one can use the inbuilt `norm` function to calculate norms:
 ```julia
 norm([1,-2,3]) == norm([1,-2,3], 2) == sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2);
 norm([1,-2,3], 1) == sqrt(1 + 2 + 3);
 norm([1,-2,3], Inf) == 3;
 ```


## 2. Matrix norms
 Just like vectors, matrices have norms that measure their "length".  The simplest example is the Fröbenius norm, 
 defined for an $m \times n$ real matrix $A$ as
$$
\|A\|_F := \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n A_{kj}^2}
$$
This is available as `norm` in Julia:
```julia
A = randn(5,3)
norm(A) == norm(vec(A))
```

While this is the simplest norm, it is not the most useful.  Instead, we will build a matrix norm from a 
vector norm:



**Definition (matrix-norm)** Suppose $A ∈ ℝ^{m × n}$  and consider two norms $\| ⋅ \|_X$ on $ℝ^n$  and 
$\| ⋅ \|_Y$ on $ℝ^n$. Define the _(induced) matrix norm_ as:
$$
\|A \|_{X → Y} := \sup_{𝐯 : \|𝐯\|_X=1} \|A 𝐯\|_Y
$$
Also define
$$
\|A\|_X \triangleq \|A\|_{X \rightarrow X}
$$

For  the induced 2, 1, and $∞$-norm we use
$$
\|A\|_2, \|A\|_1 \qquad \hbox{and} \qquad \|A\|_∞.
$$

Note an equivalent definition of the induced norm:
$$
\|A\|_{X → Y} = \sup_{𝐱 ∈ ℝ^n, 𝐱 ≠ 0} {\|A 𝐱\|_Y \over \| 𝐱\|_X}
$$
This follows since we can scale $𝐱$ by its norm so that it has unit norm, that is,
${𝐱} \over \|𝐱\|_X$ has unit norm.

**Lemma (matrix norms are norms)** Induced matrix norms are norms, that is for $\| ⋅ \| = \| ⋅ \|_{X → Y}$ we have:
1. Triangle inequality: $\| A + B \| ≤  \|A\| + \|B\|$
1. Homogeneneity: $\|c A \| = |c| \|A\|$
3. Positive-definiteness: $\|A\| =0 \Rightarrow A = 0$

In addition, they satisfy the following additional properties:
1. $\|A 𝐱 \|_Y ≤ \|A\|_{X → Y} \|𝐱 \|_X$
2. Multiplicative inequality: $\| AB\|_{X → Z} ≤ \|A \|_{Y → Z} \|B\|_{X →  Y}$

**Proof**

First we show the _triangle inequality_:
$$
\|A + B \| ≤ \sup_{𝐯 : \|𝐯\|_X=1} (\|A 𝐯\|_Y + \|B 𝐯\|_Y) ≤ \| A \| + \|B \|.
$$
Homogeneity is also immediate. Positive-definiteness follows from the fact that if
$\|A\| = 0$ then $A 𝐱  = 0$ for all $𝐱 ∈ ℝ^n$.
The property $\|A 𝐱 \|_Y ≤ \|A\|_{X → Y} \|𝐱 \|_X$ follows from the definition.
Finally, the multiplicative inequality follows from
$$
\|A B\| = \sup_{𝐯 : \|𝐯\|_X=1} \|A B 𝐯 |_Z ≤ \sup_{𝐯 : \|𝐯\|_X=1} \|A\|_{Y → Z} \| B 𝐯 | = \|A \|_{Y → Z} \|B\|_{X →  Y}
$$



∎

We have some simple examples of induced norms:

**Example ($1$-norm)** We claim 
$$
\|A \|_1 = \max_j \|𝐚_j\|_1
$$
that is, the maximum $1$-norm of the columns. To see this use the triangle inequality to
find for $\|𝐱\|_1 = 1$
$$
\| A 𝐱 \|_1 ≤ ∑_{j = 1}^n |x_j| \| 𝐚_j\|_1 ≤ \max_j \| 𝐚_j\| ∑_{j = 1}^n |x_j| = \max_j \| 𝐚_j\|_1.
$$
But the bound is also attained since if $j$ is the column that maximises the norms then
$$
\|A 𝐞_j \|_1 = \|𝐚_j\|_1 =  \max_j \| 𝐚_j\|_1.
$$

In the problem sheet we see that
$$
\|A\|_∞ = \max_k \|A[k,:]\|_1
$$
that is, the maximum $1$-norm of the rows.

Matrix norms are available via `opnorm`:
```julia
m,n = 5,3
A = randn(m,n)
opnorm(A,1) == maximum(norm(A[:,j],1) for j = 1:n)
opnorm(A,Inf) == maximum(norm(A[k,:],1) for k = 1:m)
opnorm(A) # the 2-norm
```


An example that does not have a simple formula is $\|A \|_2$, but we do have two simple cases:

**Proposition (diagonal/orthogonal 2-norms)** If $Λ$ is diagonal with entries $λ_k$ then
$\|Λ\|_2 = \max_k |λ_k|.$. If $Q$ is orthogonal then $\|Q\| = 1$.
