# # Lab 6: Least squares, QR and Cholesky
# This lab explores the the least squares problem for fitting functions with polynomials,
# computing the QR factorisation with both reflections and rotations,
# and implementing a tridiagonal Cholesky decomposition (which we shall see later arises in the 1D Poisson equation).

# ------

# When $m = n$ a least squares fit by a polynomial becomes _interpolation_:
# the approximating polynomial will fit the data exactly.
# Whether an interpolation is actually close to a function is a subtle question,
# involving properties of the function, distribution of the sample points $x_1,…,x_n$,
# and round-off error.
# A classic example is:
# $$
#   f_M(x) = {1 \over M x^2 + 1}
# $$
# where the choice of $M$ can dictate whether interpolation at evenly spaced points converges.
#


# **Problem 1.1** Find and plot the best least squares fit of $f_M$ by degree $n$
# polynomials for $n = 0,…,10$ at 1000 evenly spaced points between $0$ and $1$.



# ------- 

# **Problem 2** Complete the following function that implements
#  Householder QR using only $O(mn^2)$ operations.
# You may choose to use your implementation of `Reflection` and `Reflections` from PS5.
# Hint: to find the inner product of a vector `w` with each column of a matrix 
# `R` one can write `w'R`.
function householderqr(A)
    T = eltype(A)
    m,n = size(A)
    if m < n
        error("Only support more than or equal rows than columns")
    end
    ## TODO: construct Q and R using O(m*n^2) operations
    ## via Householder reflections.

# ------

# An alternative to using reflections to introduce zeros is to use rotations.
# This is particularly convenient for tridiagonal matrices, where one needs to only
# make one sub-diagonal zero. Here we explore a tridiagonal QR built from rotations
# in a way that the factorisation can be computed in $O(n)$ operations.


# **Problem 3.1** Complete the implementation of `Rotations`, which represents an orthogonal matrix `Q` that is a product
# of rotations of angle `θ[k]`, each acting on the entries `k:k+1`. That is, it returns $Q = Q_1⋯Q_k$ such that
# $$
# Q_k[k:k+1,k:k+1] = 
# \begin{bmatrix}
# \cos θ[k] & -\sin θ[k]\\
# \sin θ[k] & \cos θ[k]
# \end{bmatrix}
# $$

# **Problem 3.2** Combine `Rotations` and `UpperTridiagonal` from last problem sheet
# to implement a banded QR decomposition, `bandedqr`, that only takes $O(n)$ operations. Hint: the
# `atan(y,x)` function gives the angle of a vector [x,y].

    n = size(A, 1)

# We now consider a Cholesky factorisation for tridiagonal matrices. Since we are assuming the
# matrix is symmetric, we will use a special type `SymTridiagonal` that captures the symmetry.
# In particular, `SymTridiagonal(dv, eu) == Tridiagonal(ev, dv, ev)`.

# **Problem 4** Complete the following
# implementation of `mycholesky` to return a `Bidiagonal` cholesky factor in $O(n)$ operations.

    ld = zeros(T, n) # diagonal entries of L
