# # Lab 7: Function compression and the SVD

# This lecture will explore using the SVD to compress 2D functions sampled at an 
# evenly spaced grid. This is very much the same as image compression,
# but we will see that samples of smooth functions can be approximated by very small rank matrices.  
# This gives some intuition on why pictures tend to be low rank: most pictures have large portions that are "smooth".



# The following code samples a function on a grid in the square `[-1,1]^2`
# and plots the corresponding pixels:

using Plots, LinearAlgebra, Test

f = (x,y) -> exp(-x^2*sin(2y-1))

m,n = 150,100
x = range(-1, 1; length=n)
y = range(-1, 1; length=m)

F = f.(x', y) # equivalent to [f(x[j],y[k]) for k=1:m, j=1:n]

heatmap(x, y, F)

# **Problem 1** Complete the following function `fsample(f, m, n)` which takes in a function
# and returns its samples on a grid.

function fsample(f::Function, m::Int, n::Int)
    ## TODO: return `f` sampled at an evenly spaced grid on the square [-1, 1]^2
    ## with n points in the x direction and
    ## n points in the y direction, returning an m × n matrix
    
end

@test_broken fsample(f, m, n) == F

# ## Singular values of 2D function samples 

# We will  see experimentally that the singular values 
# tell us something about the structure functions.  Recall from lectures 
# the singular value decomposition is a matrix factorization of a 
# matrix $A ∈ ℝ^{m × n}$ of the form
#
# $$
# A = U Σ V^⊤
# $$
#
# where $U ∈ ℝ^{m × r}$, $Σ ∈ ℝ^{r × r}$ and $V ∈ ℝ^{n × r}$, where $U$ and $V$
# have orthogonal columns and $Σ$ is diagonal.   The singular values are the diagonal entries of $Σ$.

# Note that `svdvals(A)` calculates the singular values of a matrix `A`, without calculating
# the `U` and `V` components.

# **Problem 2.1** Use `plot(...; yscale=:log10)` and `svdvals` to plot the singular values of 
# $f(x,y) = \exp(-x^2 \sin(2y-1))$ sampled at a $100 × 150$ evenly spaced grid on $[-1,1]^2$. 
# At what value does it appear to level off? 



# **Problem 2.2** Repeat Problem 2.1, but plotting the first 20 singular values divided by `n`
# for `n = m = 50`, `n = m = 100`, and `n = m = 200` on the same figure.  What do you notice?  
# Hint: recall `plot!` adds a plot to an existing plot.



# **Problem 2.3** Plot the first 50 singular values for `n = m = 200` of
#  $\cos(ωxy)$ and $\cos(ωx) \cos(ωy)$ for `ω` equal to 1,10 and 50, on the same figure. 
# How do the singular values change as the functions become more oscillatory in both examples?



# **Problem 2.4** Plot the singular values of ${\rm sign}(x-y)$ for `n=m=100` 
# and `n=m=200`.  What do you notice?  



# -----
# ## Matrix compression

# We now turn to using the SVD to compress matrices.

# **Problem 3.1** Write a function `svdcompress(A::Matrix, k::Integer)` that returns the best rank-`k` approximation to `A`,
# using the in-built `svd` command.



# **Problem 3.2** Compare a `heatmap` plot of `fsample((x,y) -> exp(-x^2*sin(2y-1)), 100, 100)` to its best rank-5 approximation.
# What do you observe?



# **Problem 3.3** Write a function `svdcompress_rank(A::Matrix, ε::Real)` that returns the smallest integer `k` so that `norm(A - svdcompress(A, k)) ≤ ε`,
# which we call the "numerical rank".   (Hint: use the singular values instead of guess-and-check.)


function svdcompress_rank(A::Matrix, ε::Real)
    ## TODO: determine and return rank-k approximation
    
end
F = fsample((x,y) -> exp(-x^2*sin(2y-1)), 100, 100)
@test_broken svdcompress_rank(F, 1E-10) == 10



# **Problem 3.4** Use `svdcompress_rank` to roughly estimate how the numerical rank of the Hilbert matrix 
# $$
# H_n := \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1/2 & 1/3 & ⋯ & 1/n \\
#                       1/2 & 1/3 & 1/4 & ⋯ & 1/(n+1) \\
#                        1/3 & 1/4 & 1/5 & ⋯ & 1/(n+2) \\
#                        ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋱ & ⋮ \\
#                        1/n & 1/(n+1) & 1/(n+2) & ⋯ & 1/(2n-1)
#                        \end{bmatrix}
# $$
# grows as a function
# of $n$ up to $n = 200$, for $ε = 10^{-10}$. 
# Hint: scaling just the x axis in a plot via `plot(...; xscale=:log10)` will reveal logarithmic
# growth.

# We will see later in the module (time-permitting) that divided differences lead naturally to
# methods for solving differential equations. For example, if we take the equation
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# u(0) &= 1, \\
# u'(t) &= a u(t)
# \end{align*}
# $$
# and consider the solution on a grid of evenly spaced points $t_0,t_1,…,t_n = 0, h, 2h, …, (n-1)h, 1$,
# where $h = 1/n$,
# we have
# $$
# 0 = u'(t_k) - a u(t_k) ≈ {u(t_{k+1}) - u(t_k) \over h} - a u(t_k).
# $$
# Writing $u_k ≈ u(t_k)$ we get a _discrete_ version of the ODE:
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# u_0 &= 1, \\
# u_{k+1}/h - (1/h+a)u_k &= 0\qquad\hbox{ for $k = 0,…,n-1$}
# \end{align*}
# $$
# Solving this linear system gives an approximation to the solution to the ODE (in this case $u(t) = \exp(a t)$).

# **Problem 5.1** Complete the following function that returns a (lower) `Bidiagonal` matrix of dimension
# (n+1) × (n+1) representing the above linear system, i.e., acting on the vector `[u_0,u_1,…,u_n]`.
# Hint: recall the `fill` command and that `[1; vc]` will concatenate the number `1` with a vector `vc`.

function forwardeuler(a, n)
    ## TODO: return a Bidiagonal matrix representing the above linerar system
    
end

n = 100_000
x = range(0, 1; length=n+1)
@test_broken forwardeuler(1, n) isa Bidiagonal
@test_broken norm(forwardeuler(1, n) \ [1; zeros(n)] - exp.(x)) ≤ 0.005

# **Problem 5.2** For $a = 1$, plot the condition number of `forwardeuler(1,n)` for increasing $n$, up to 
# $n = 200$. Can you estimate at what rate the condition number is growing? I.e., if the growth can be bounded by
# $C n^α$ give a conjecture on what $α$ is sufficient.  What does this tell us about a bound on the growth in round-off error in the approximation?
# Hint: if you scale both the x axis and y axis logarithmically via `plot(...; xscale=:log10, yscale=:log10)` 
# then the slope indicates which algebraic rate a function is growing. You may plot $n^α$ for varying $α$ to find a slope that
# is bigger than the observed data.
