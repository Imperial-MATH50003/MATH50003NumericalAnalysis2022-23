    "In this chapter, we introduce the [Two's-complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement)\n",
    "storage for integers and the \n",
    "[IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).\n",
    "There are many  possible ways of representing real numbers on a computer, as well as \n",
    "the precise behaviour of operations such as addition, multiplication, etc.\n",
    "Before the 1980s each processor had potentially a different representation for \n",
    "real numbers, as well as different behaviour for operations.  \n",
    "IEEE introduced in 1985 was a means to standardise this across\n",
    "processors so that algorithms would produce consistent and reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter may seem very low level for a mathematics course but there are\n",
    "two important reasons to understand the behaviour of integers and floating-point numbers:\n",
    "1. Integer arithmetic can suddenly start giving wrong negative answers when numbers\n",
    "become large.\n",
    "2. Floating-point arithmetic is very precisely defined, and can even be used\n",
    "in rigorous computations as we shall see in the problem sheets. But it is not exact\n",
    "and its important to understand how errors in computations can accumulate.\n",
    "3. Failure to understand floating-point arithmetic can cause catastrophic issues\n",
    "in practice, with the extreme example being the \n",
    "[explosion of the Ariane 5 rocket](https://youtu.be/N6PWATvLQCY?t=86).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we discuss the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary representation: Any real number can be represented in binary, that is,\n",
    "by an infinite sequence of 0s and 1s (bits). We review  binary representation.\n",
    "2. Integers:  There are multiple ways of representing integers on a computer. We discuss the \n",
    "the different types of integers and their representation as bits, and how arithmetic operations behave \n",
    "like modular arithmetic. As an advanced topic we discuss `BigInt`, which uses variable bit length storage.\n",
    "2. Floating-point numbers: Real numbers are stored on a computer with a finite number of bits. \n",
    "There are three types of floating-point numbers: _normal numbers_, _subnormal numbers_, and _special numbers_.\n",
    "3. Arithmetic: Arithmetic operations in floating-point are exact up to rounding, and how the\n",
    "rounding mode can be set. This allows us to bound  errors computations.\n",
    "4. High-precision floating-point numbers: As an advanced topic, we discuss how the precision of floating-point arithmetic can be increased arbitrary\n",
    "using `BigFloat`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we load two external packages. SetRounding.jl allows us \n",
    "to set the rounding mode of floating-point arithmetic. ColorBitstring.jl\n",
    "  implements functions `printbits` (and `printlnbits`)\n",
    "which print the bits (and with a newline) of floating-point numbers in colour."
